<h1>Authorization Form</h1>
<p>A client just called you to say that they love their new website! There’s only one problem: they don’t like how their contact page displays their personal information for all to see.</p>

<p>They’ve asked you to hide their website’s contact page behind a password form. In this project, you’ll accomplish this by using a React component to set up a simple authorization layer.</p>

<p>Let’s get started!</p>
